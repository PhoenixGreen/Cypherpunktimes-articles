## Thesis statement

A global peer to peer digital currency network is a massive ledger of every transaction ever created from the genesis to the present day. For a network to remain peer to peer, solutions need to be found that reduce the burden of running the network and also allow for frictionless payments of the smallest qualities.

Outline:
* The factors that define a micro transaction
* What can micro transactions be used for
* How do platforms compare when processing these transactions?
	* Fees
	* Transaction size on-chain
	* Average time it takes to process, 100k transactions
	* Any other considerations?


## Pre-discussion, research and questions

What average fees do specific scaling blockchains charge?
What is the size of an average transaction on these chains?
Block times and block sizes of scaling blockchains?
What it takes to run these chains? Blockchain size, ram, processing power, storage.

Which chains should I compare?
I’m currently thinking of doing: Solana, Polygon, Dash, Nano, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and the Lightning Network.
