## Thesis statement

Is Decred's Lightning Network non-custodial? The aim of this discussion is to highlight and find answers to the misconceptions and misinformation surrounding the non-custodial nature of the Lightning Network.

## Pre-discussion, research and questions

* Do peers need to run an always on LN node to use the Lightning Network in a non-custodial nature?
* Do peers need to be on-line at the same time to transact over the Lightning Network?
* Do peers need to give up custody of funds to use the Lightning Network?
* Do peers need to trust centralised middleman / servers to use the Lightning Network?
