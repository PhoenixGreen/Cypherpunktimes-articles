# Cypherpunktimes-articles

## This new repo is for collaborative work on CT content.

## Testing out the review process. I need to write a list of instruction.

Steps:

1. Fork the "reviewed-articles" folder. I called the new folder "articles-for-review". This has copied the complete repo
2. In the "articles-for-review" fork go to the "reviewed-articles" folder and create a new document
3. Share link of this document in the writers channel for review
4. ?? In the "pull request" area you'll see the versions of this document ??
5. ?? Click on the latest one, which is at the bottom of the list ??
6. ?? Clicking on a + icon will allow you and others to add comments to the relevant section of the article ??
7. ??
