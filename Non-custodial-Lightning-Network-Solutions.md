Thesis statement 

The Lightning Network has achieved the monumental target of processing thousands of micro-transactions per second at the cost of a single Atom/Satoshi. But is it possible to have this functional in a non-custodial wallet?

Pre-discussion, research and questions:
* What are the most popular LN wallets?
* How do these platforms open and close channels? Are there any restrictions or limitations?
* How do these platforms facilitate inbound liquidity?
* Who provides the liquidity and at what cost?
* What are the fees for opening and closing channels?
* What are the fees for transacting over LN on these platforms?

* Is the LN processing done client-side or server-side on these platforms?
* Are any of these platforms using Neutrino SPV?
* Are any of the platforms using Electrum lite-clients?
* If not Neutrino / Electrum, how is this service being provided? e.g. fully centralised server model.
