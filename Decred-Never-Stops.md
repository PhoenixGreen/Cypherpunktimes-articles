# Article / TitleDecred's Eternal Drive: Perseverance in the Face of Crypto Challenges

Text: 
In the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency, where projects often rise and fall with the tides of market sentiment, one project stands out for its commitment to progress: Decred. Born from a proposal on the Bitcointalk forum back in April 2013, Decred emerged as a beacon of innovation and resilience in the crypto space.

At its core, Decred was envisioned not just as another digital currency, but as a new project/workplace for the future of decentralized finance. Spearheaded by visionary minds like tacotime, _ingsoc, and Jake Yocom-Piatt, Decred took shape as a hybrid of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus systems, drawing inspiration from the Memcoin2 cryptocurrency.

Decred's journey isn't just about creating a new form of currency; it is about building an ecosystem where innovation thrives. Decred's hybrid model not only ensures security and decentralization but also fosters a culture of continuous development and adaptation. Let's check what makes Decred a unique project!

## A Legacy of Innovation

The innovation lies at the core of the Decred project, driving its pursuit of progress in the blockchain ecosystem. Formed by a team of exceptional developers, where many have worked for big companies and coded for big projects, such as Bitcoin, Decred stands out as a fertile ground for forward-thinking solutions and blockchain applications. Decred's unique hybrid consensus model is central to its ability to stay at the forefront of innovation which enables swift adoption of new technologies and methodologies.

Decred's network operates on a unique hybrid consensus protocol, blending two key approaches: Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS). In this setup full nodes meticulously compile transaction lists for future blocks, ensuring adherence to specified requirements such as fees, fund availability, and prevention of double spending. Meanwhile, miners engage in solving cryptographic puzzles, aiming to construct the subsequent block. Upon puzzle solution, miners incorporate as many transactions as feasible from the network's full nodes into the block. This block is then introduced to the Decred blockchain as unmined, pending verification. Up to five randomly selected Proof-of-Stake (POS) tickets then scrutinize the block against consensus rules, and upon successful validation, it is officially added to the blockchain.

Employing a Hybrid Proof-of-Work/Proof-of-Stake (PoW/PoS) consensus mechanism presents numerous advantages over alternative consensus models within the Decred ecosystem. Firstly, it effectively tackles energy-related issues commonly associated with pure Proof-of-Work systems. Secondly, it mitigates the risk of blockchain attacks by validators possessing significant coin holdings, a concern prevalent in solely Proof-of-Stake networks.

But innovation requires more than just talent and a hybrid consensus; it requires resources and autonomy. That's where Decred's treasury comes into play. Unlike many other projects that rely on external investors, Decred has its own treasury, meticulously tracked and transparently accessible on the blockchain. This fund serves as a pillar of autonomy, ensuring that Decred remains self-sufficient in its pursuit of innovation. 

Anyone can submit a proposal to use the treasury funds on the Politeia platform, Decred's governance platform. Stakeholders have the authority to decide if the funds should be used for a proposal. Politeia creates an environment for discussion and voting, where the community can debate the proposals and give their takes on why money should/shouldn't be used to fund an initiative. Exitus, Decred contributor and leader of the Vanguard initiative gives his take on the Decred governance:

"Decred isn't built to stagnate; its governance processes encourage ongoing proposals and the development of new features and improvements. The focus is on steady evolution, not hype-driven cycles. Year after year, there are updates and improvements, especially on the backend, as seen in the Decred Journal(https://www.cypherpunktimes.com/decred-journal-november-2023/). A good example of overcoming challenges is the block reward alterations and the creation of the DCRDEX to allow for true price discovery."

As an example of a treasury-funded initiative, we have this website: Cypherpunktimes.com. First created as Decred Magazine, this website is a platform to spread information/opinions about the crypto market, the latest blockchain technology, and related news. Stakeholders have found this an important initiative to the marketing of the project, and voted to fund it!

There are many other examples of ongoing development and marketing projects. Those can be viewed on the Decred governance platform ([Politeia link](https://proposals.decred.org/). 

## Continuous development

Browsing through Decred's GitHub repository, you'll quickly notice the dedication of the community toward driving constant improvements and pushing the boundaries of innovation. It's a rare sight to come across any of the project's applications or software that hasn't seen updates in the past seven days. The development team is on the run, ensuring the codebase remains current, addressing potential errors, and seamlessly integrating new enhancements.

Several Decred applications are constantly updated, some of them are:

i) Timestamply: This innovative tool, Timestamply, was developed to simplify the process of proving the existence of digital content, a feature crucial for a wide range of applications requiring attestation. Whether it's for legal documentation, intellectual property protection, or academic research, Timestamply provides a reliable solution for verifying the authenticity and existence of digital assets.

ii) DCRDEX: Enter DCRDEX, the decentralized exchange (DEX) that's redefining the way users engage in crypto trading. With its revolutionary approach, DCRDEX eliminates arbitrary fees, empowering users with complete control over their assets. Say goodbye to intermediaries and hello to true financial autonomy as DCRDEX ensures that users retain full custody of their coins throughout the trading process.

iii) Bison Relay: In a world where online content is often subject to censorship, surveillance, and gatekeeping, Bison Relay offers a refreshing alternative. This groundbreaking platform introduces a new paradigm for social media, where freedom of expression reigns supreme. By prioritizing privacy, transparency, and user empowerment, Bison Relay creates a space where individuals can freely share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences without fear of suppression or manipulation.

Decred contributors are committed to cultivating a vibrant ecosystem that not only encourages innovation but also embodies values like transparency, autonomy, and user empowerment. Decred's new paradigm of work integrates individuals with valuable skills and ideas from around the world, ensuring fair compensation for those responsible for enhancing the project and introducing new concepts.

## Outreach efforts

Just like any other crypto project Decred does not maintain itself just with development, but also with outreach efforts coordinated by its community members. Those efforts have two main goals, which are: i)spreading the Decred word, making the project and its ethos known by the crypto community and investors; and ii)Explaining Decred, keeping the community and interested people informed about the project ethos, latest updates, and researches that are being made. 

The Vanguard team is a community-driven initiative aimed at boosting Decred's presence across social media platforms. Contributors are motivated to strategize, organize, and amplify Decred's message. Anyone passionate about advancing DCR's growth is welcome to join and contribute to the cause. Tivra stands out as one of the most engaged members of Vanguard. Beyond spreading the word about Decred, he recognizes the immense value in connecting with various crypto communities and appreciates the unique approaches each brings to the table: 

"My outreach efforts via the Vanguard proposal involve making genuine connections within the crypto communities with similar principles. For instance, engaging in Monero Spaces led to meeting Vik Sharma and the incredible opportunity for Cake Wallet integration.  That kind of open collaboration speaks to Decred's spirit as an adaptive DAO – we learn, evolve, and find synergies where others might see only competition.  Decred's strength lies in community governance, and I strongly believe outreach means bringing that model to more people, and welcoming new stakeholders who will shape its future."
