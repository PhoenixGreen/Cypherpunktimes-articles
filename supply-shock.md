# Understanding the Impact of Supply Shock on Cryptocurrency


## Explanation of supply shock with regard to cryptocurrency

Supply shocks can happen suddenly and are unexpected. It dramatically changes the effects of supply which leads to an unexpected change in the price. These events can be positive or negative which lead to an increase or drop in the supply. For example, the price of a cryptocurrency could shoot up when there is little supply or could shoot down when there is an oversupply, this is all when the demand remains constant.

Understanding the causes of supply shock is essential for investors as it can have a massive impact on people's investment strategy.

Cryptocurrencies normally have a predetermined supply schedule or a fixed issuance rate encoded into their code. Decred, for example, has a capped supply of 21 million coins, with any new coins mined coming at a gradually decreasing rate over time. This finite supply creates scarcity, making each unit of the cryptocurrency more valuable as demand increases.

Supply shock events occur for many reasons. A common one would be the Bitcoin halving. The halving means the block reward for miners is reduced by half, leading to a sudden reduction in the rate of new coins produced. This supply reduction often results in increased buying pressure and upward price movements.

Regulatory issues can also lead to supply shock events. For example, if mining is banned in a certain country or if assets are frozen on an exchange.


## Importance of supply dynamics in cryptocurrency markets

Supply dynamics are very important in cryptocurrency markets. It is probably the number one driver of price movements. Traditional fiat currencies can be printed at the whim of a central bank. There are no supply constraints. More money can be pumped into the system at any time as we have seen only recently during Covid where the US Dollar doubled the supply overnight. This has led to inflation which wreaks havoc on the poorer classes of society.


## Overview of how these events can affect cryptocurrency prices

We have already discussed events that can have an effect on cryptocurrency supply like the Bitcoin halving. On the other hand events that increase the supply such as minting of tokens or the unlocking of restricted tokens can dilute the supply. This could have a negative supply shock on the price of the cryptocurrency.


## Definition of supply shock and factors that cause it along with examples from historical occurrences

Supply shock refers to a sudden and significant disruption in the supply of an asset. It can lead to changes in availability and price. When it comes to cryptocurrencies this normally occurs when the supply of coins on the market becomes less and less.

Historical examples include Bitcoin's halving events in 2012, 2016, and 2020. These led to price rallies as the reduction in new supply meant miner's rewards dropped and also investors' demand grew because of scarcity.

Ethereum's Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559 introduced in 2021, brought with it a deflationary mechanism by burning some fees, resulting in a supply shock that contributed to the appreciation of Ether's price.

## Decred and Supply Shock:
## Decred fixed supply, move to PoS. History of limited supply with staking and where we are now

Decred supply is fixed at 21 million coins. From the latest figures I have (19/03/2024)

- Total coin supply currently is 15,931,541 DCR
- Total staked is 9,848,611 DCR
- Treasury holds 871,692 DCR
- Estimated lost coins or unmoved from dormant/inactive accounts has been roughly estimated at 1 million. We cannot say for sure though.
  

This could mean Decred is one of the scarcest cryptocurrencies on the market with maybe 3 million circulating supply.

Decred moved from PoW to mainly PoS because it was becoming apparent that the miners were mining DCR and then appeared to be selling off the coins mined. They did not show an active interest in holding DCR and were most likely just profiting.

Now with mainly PoS stakeholders can stake their coins in the form of a ticket(Ticket cost varies but as of today the price is 234 DCR). Now instead of the miners earning the reward, the stakeholders will earn the reward. The stakeholders will also have active participation in the community and are unlikely to sell their rewards so freely on the open market.

As more coins are staked, the available supply for trading diminishes, potentially leading to increased scarcity and upward price pressure. 

## What happens in markets when these supply events occur:

## Investor reactions, Price action, and volatility surrounding supply shock events. The impact on market sentiment, volumes, and long-term price trends.

## Strategies to deploy during these events:

## Managing risk and noticing long-term projections

## Potential future supply shock scenarios:

## Investors should understand these events and how to notice when they start and how to take advantage.
