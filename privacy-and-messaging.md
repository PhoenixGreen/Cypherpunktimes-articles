# Secure Chat Showdown

In today's society communication plays a key role while issues surrounding privacy and security have become increasingly prominent. With well-known messaging applications vying for our focus, it is crucial to weigh the pros and cons of these platforms.

This piece will explore messaging apps such, as Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Signal, WeChat, and Telegram. Additionally, we will look at Bison Relay created by the Decred project as an exciting newcomer.

## Encryption Protocols:

Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp: Owned by the same parent company (Meta), both Messenger and WhatsApp use end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by default for text messages, voice calls, and video calls. This is meant to ensure only the sender and receiver can see the messages. Concerns however have been raised over metadata collection and how this plays out in Meta's broader ecosystem.

Signal: Signal is well known for its dedication to protecting privacy. It receives praise for using an open-source protocol, robust encryption methods, and limited data collection practices. Signal places a value on safeguarding user privacy by providing end-to-end encryption, for all interactions and only retaining essential metadata.

Bison Relay: Emerging as a newcomer in the messaging space, Bison Relay emphasizes privacy, including decentralized architecture, and with the use of Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) users can have enhanced anonymity. Bison Relay aims to provide users with a secure and censorship-resistant platform for communication.

Direct from BisonRelay.org :
Bison Relay is a Decred-based communications tool that enables free speech, and free association, and can act as a fully independent alternative stack to the web. Bison Relay is an asynchronous client-server protocol that makes heavy use of the Decred Lightning Network, where every message is sent encrypted, metadata-minimized, and paid for via LN micropayment. The Bison Relay server is accountless and every message is handled individually, where it is both paid for prior to being sent and then received. Bison Relay tightly integrates payments, messaging, and social media, and implements a peer-to-peer social media functionality of making posts to subscribers, subscribing to users’ posts, relaying posts, and replying to posts and comments on posts.

WeChat: While immensely popular in China and beyond, WeChat has faced scrutiny over its handling of user data and compliance with Chinese government regulations. Despite offering encryption for messages sent over its platform, WeChat's ties to Chinese authorities raise concerns about data access and surveillance.

Telegram: Telegram's approach to encryption has evolved over the years, initially offering a proprietary encryption protocol before adopting the more widely accepted MTProto protocol. While Telegram provides optional end-to-end encryption for "secret chats," its default mode does not offer the same level of security, leading to criticism from privacy advocates.

## Which messaging platform is best?

If your choice of encrypted messaging app is between Signal, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, WeChat, and WhatsApp, do not waste your time with anything but Signal. If we are talking purely about privacy and if privacy's what you're after, nothing beats Signal from the current popular messaging apps.

You may recall Elon Musk tweeting in support of Signal and telling people to ditch WhatsApp. Jack Dorsey also retweeted Musk's tweet at the time. It was around then the number of new users flocking to Signal and Telegram surged by tens of millions. 

This little debacle reignited security and privacy scrutiny over messaging apps. Among the top players currently dominating download numbers, there are some commonalities. All are mobile apps available in the Google Play store and App Store that support cross-platform messaging, have group chat features, offer multifactor authentication, and can be used to share files and multimedia. They all also provide encryption for texting, voice, and video calls.

## Privacy Policies and Data Collection:

Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp: Both Messenger and WhatsApp have faced criticism for their data collection practices, including the sharing of user data with Facebook for targeted advertising purposes. While end-to-end encryption protects message contents, metadata such as timestamps, device information, and contact lists may still be collected and utilized for tracking and profiling purposes.

Signal: Signal sets itself apart with its minimal data collection policies and transparency. The platform collects only the bare minimum of user data necessary for operation, such as phone numbers for registration, and commits to never monetizing user data or displaying ads.

Bison Relay: As a privacy-focused platform, Bison Relay prioritizes user anonymity and data protection. By leveraging decentralized architecture and encryption, Bison Relay minimizes the collection of identifiable user data, thereby reducing the risk of surveillance and data breaches.

WeChat: WeChat's privacy policies have come under scrutiny for their compliance with Chinese government regulations, which require data localization and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. While WeChat offers encryption for messages in transit, concerns persist regarding data access by government agencies and potential censorship of content.

Telegram: Telegram's approach to privacy has been met with mixed reviews. While the platform offers optional end-to-end encryption for secret chats, its default mode does not provide the same level of security. Additionally, Telegram's cloud-based messaging service raises concerns about data storage and access.

## Additional Security Features:

Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp: In addition to encryption, Messenger and WhatsApp offer features such as two-factor authentication (2FA) and self-destructing messages for enhanced security. However, concerns remain about their integration with Facebook's broader ecosystem and the potential for data sharing across platforms.

Signal: Signal goes above and beyond in its commitment to security, offering features such as disappearing messages, screen security, and a built-in secure messaging protocol. These features enhance user privacy and protect against unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Bison Relay: Bison Relay privacy is based on a unique combination of a Double Ratchet and post-quantum-secure Public Key Infrastructure. The Double Ratchet creates forward and “reverse” secrecy, meaning a temporary compromise of an endpoint does not compromise all future or all prior message encryption keys. Additionally, the Double Ratchet provides deniable messaging, where either endpoint could have written any message in question. Post-quantum-secure Public Key Infrastructure reinforces the Double Ratchet privacy by protecting it against attacks by quantum computers, and it also makes man-in-the-middle attacks more difficult.

WeChat: While WeChat offers encryption for messages in transit, the platform lacks advanced security features found in other messaging apps. Users are encouraged to exercise caution when communicating sensitive information over the platform, particularly in light of government regulations and potential surveillance.

Telegram: In addition to optional end-to-end encryption for secret chats, Telegram offers features such as self-destructing messages and the ability to password-protect conversations. While these features enhance user privacy, concerns persist about Telegram's cloud-based messaging service and data storage practices.


## Real examples of security breaches or issues that have occurred with these applications

Jeff Bezos' phone was famously hacked in January 2020 through a WhatsApp video message. In December of the same year, Texas' attorney general alleged that Facebook and Google struck a back-room deal to reveal WhatsApp message content. A spyware vendor targeted a WhatsApp vulnerability with its software to hack 1,400 devices, resulting in a lawsuit from Facebook. WhatsApp's unencrypted cloud-based backup feature has long been considered a security risk by privacy experts.  

When WhatsApp says it can't view the content of the encrypted messages you send to another WhatsApp user, what it doesn't say is that there's a list of other data that it collects that could be linked to your identity: Your unique device ID, usage and advertising data, purchase history and financial information, physical location, phone number, your contact information and that of your list of contacts, what products you've interacted with, how often you use the app, and how it performs when you do. The list goes on. This is way more than Signal or Telegram. 

## Offer guidance to users on selecting the most secure application based on their individual needs and concerns regarding privacy.
