# Secure Chat Showdown

We live in a world where communication is paramount. At the same time, concerns over privacy and security are at an all-time high. With a large number of popular messaging apps striving for our attention it's important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of these platforms.

In this article, we will discuss a number of popular messaging apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Signal, WeChat, and Telegram. We will also take a look at Bison Relay developed by the Decred project as a new exciting newcomer to the space.

## Encryption Protocols:

Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp: Owned by the same parent company (Meta), both Messenger and WhatsApp use end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by default for text messages, voice calls, and video calls. This is meant to ensure only the sender and receiver can see the messages. Concerns however have been raised over metadata collection and how this plays out in Meta's broader ecosystem.

Signal: Renowned for its unwavering commitment to privacy, Signal is praised for its open-source protocol, robust encryption, and minimal data collection policies. As an independent nonprofit organization, Signal prioritizes user privacy above all else, offering end-to-end encryption for all communications and minimal metadata retention.

Bison Relay: Emerging as a newcomer in the messaging space, Bison Relay emphasizes privacy features, including decentralized architecture and onion routing for enhanced anonymity. Bison Relay aims to provide users with a secure and censorship-resistant platform for communication.

Direct from BisonRelay.org :
Bison Relay is a Decred-based communications tool that enables free speech, free association, and can act as a fully independent alternative stack to the web. Bison Relay is an asynchronous client-server protocol that makes heavy use of the Decred Lightning Network, where every message is sent encrypted, metadata-minimized, and paid for via LN micropayment. The Bison Relay server is accountless and every message is handled individually, where it is both paid for prior to being sent and then received. Bison Relay tightly integrates payments, messaging, and social media, and implements a peer-to-peer social media functionality of making posts to subscribers, subscribing to users’ posts, relaying posts, and replying to posts and comments on posts.

WeChat: While immensely popular in China and beyond, WeChat has faced scrutiny over its handling of user data and compliance with Chinese government regulations. Despite offering encryption for messages sent over its platform, WeChat's ties to Chinese authorities raise concerns about data access and surveillance.

Telegram: Telegram's approach to encryption has evolved over the years, initially offering a proprietary encryption protocol before adopting the more widely accepted MTProto protocol. While Telegram provides optional end-to-end encryption for "secret chats," its default mode does not offer the same level of security, leading to criticism from privacy advocates.

## Privacy Policies and Data Collection:

Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp: Both Messenger and WhatsApp have faced criticism for their data collection practices, including the sharing of user data with Facebook for targeted advertising purposes. While end-to-end encryption protects message contents, metadata such as timestamps, device information, and contact lists may still be collected and utilized for tracking and profiling purposes.

Signal: Signal sets itself apart with its minimal data collection policies and transparency. The platform collects only the bare minimum of user data necessary for operation, such as phone numbers for registration, and commits to never monetizing user data or displaying ads.

Bison Relay: As a privacy-focused platform, Bison Relay prioritizes user anonymity and data protection. By leveraging decentralized architecture and encryption, Bison Relay minimizes the collection of identifiable user data, thereby reducing the risk of surveillance and data breaches.

WeChat: WeChat's privacy policies have come under scrutiny for their compliance with Chinese government regulations, which require data localization and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. While WeChat offers encryption for messages in transit, concerns persist regarding data access by government agencies and potential censorship of content.

Telegram: Telegram's approach to privacy has been met with mixed reviews. While the platform offers optional end-to-end encryption for secret chats, its default mode does not provide the same level of security. Additionally, Telegram's cloud-based messaging service raises concerns about data storage and access.

## Additional Security Features:

Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp: In addition to encryption, Messenger and WhatsApp offer features such as two-factor authentication (2FA) and self-destructing messages for enhanced security. However, concerns remain about their integration with Facebook's broader ecosystem and the potential for data sharing across platforms.

Signal: Signal goes above and beyond in its commitment to security, offering features such as disappearing messages, screen security, and a built-in secure messaging protocol. These features enhance user privacy and protect against unauthorized access to sensitive information.

Bison Relay: Bison Relay privacy is based on a unique combination of a Double Ratchet and post-quantum-secure Public Key Infrastructure. The Double Ratchet creates forward and “reverse” secrecy, meaning a temporary compromise of an endpoint does not compromise all future or all prior message encryption keys. Additionally, the Double Ratchet provides deniable messaging, where either endpoint could have written any message in question. Post-quantum-secure Public Key Infrastructure reinforces the Double Ratchet privacy by protecting it against attacks by quantum computers, and it also makes man-in-the-middle attacks more difficult.

WeChat: While WeChat offers encryption for messages in transit, the platform lacks advanced security features found in other messaging apps. Users are encouraged to exercise caution when communicating sensitive information over the platform, particularly in light of government regulations and potential surveillance.

Telegram: In addition to optional end-to-end encryption for secret chats, Telegram offers features such as self-destructing messages and the ability to password-protect conversations. While these features enhance user privacy, concerns persist about Telegram's cloud-based messaging service and data storage practices.


## Real examples of security breaches or issues that have occurred with these applications

## Offer guidance to users on selecting the most secure application based on their individual needs and concerns regarding privacy.

Conclusion:

Users seeking to protect their personal information should be aware of how these messaging platforms work and what data is private. Signal and Bison Relay stand out from the crowd when it comes to privacy. Users must remain vigilant and informed about the privacy policies and security features of the messaging apps they choose to use.
