# Monero Delisted - Monthly News

### Binance to Delist Monero Privacy Token:

The crypto exchange will stop listing the token along with Aragon, Multichain and Vai as of Feb. 20.

Monero (XMR) dropped 30% on Tuesday the 6th of February to a 20-month low after Binance said it will stop listing the privacy token as of February 20th.

Monero, as well as the three other tokens to be delisted – Aragon (ANT), Multichain (MULTI) and Vai (VAI) – no longer meet the standards Binance expects, the exchange said.

"When a coin or token no longer meets this standard, or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it," Binance said.

The delisting is happening because Binance is now requiring that deposits come from a publicly transparent address. Monero has used stealth addresses for ALL addresses since it’s launch in April 2014

Monero allows selective disclosure with view keys but not a transparent address

What this means for Decred?

Decred has opt-in privacy and addresses are transparent. There doesn't appear to be a risk for Decred to be delisted.

What this means for other privacy coins/tokens?

We will have to monitor the market closely and see how this will affect other coins/tokens going forward. It appears regulation is tightening its noose on the cryptocurrency sector.

### Bitcoin soars to two-year high:

The world's largest cryptocurrency by market cap is rallying due to big investors' growing appetite. Bitcoin's price rose 10% in two days and was trading at more than $56,000 (€51,606), the highest since November 2021.

The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) had a peak of $56,940.18 (€52,472.08).

One of the main drivers of the current rally was crypto investor and software firm MicroStrategy announcing a large purchase of 3,000 bitcoins for $155 million (€143 million).
