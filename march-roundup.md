# Coinbase Outage | Monero Attack | SBF Jailed - March roundup

## Coinbase Outage

Coinbase users worldwide faced another issue with $0 crypto balances as Bitcoin reached over $67,000 for the first time in more than two years. 

This marked the second outage for Coinbase in less than a week, coinciding with Bitcoin hitting a 28-month high on March 4. The crypto fear and greed index indicated strong interest, reaching 82. 

Despite CEO Brian Armstrong stating preparedness for increased traffic after the first outage on February 28, the surge in Bitcoin activity surpassed expectations, causing another interruption. 

Although Coinbase assured users of fund safety and ongoing efforts to restore normal operations, the incident raised concerns about the exchange's readiness for heavy traffic during a bullish market cycle, as users expressed dissatisfaction with the disruption.

## Monero Attack

It has not spread to the mainstream news but it appears Monero has been subject to a flooding attack.

There are lots of theories floating about at the moment. From an interesting thread on Reddit we can see some of the possible causes but yet to have a definitive answer.

Let's explore exactly what a flooding attack is and then discuss possible reasons.

A flooding attack refers to a malicious attempt to disrupt the network by overwhelming it with a large volume of transactions or data. Unlike traditional network flooding attacks that target centralized systems, flooding attacks on blockchains aim to exploit the decentralized nature of the network to disrupt its normal operation.

Flooding attacks of blockchains can take many different shapes:

1. Transaction Flooding: This can occur when the attacker sends a large number of legitimate-looking transactions to the blockchain network. These transactions may be designed to consume excessive amounts of network bandwidth, storage space, or processing power, leading to congestion and delays in transaction processing. Transaction flooding attacks can result in increased transaction fees for legitimate users and slow down the overall network throughput.

2. Data Flooding: In a data flooding attack, the attacker floods the blockchain network with large volumes of data, such as spam transactions, invalid blocks, or malicious smart contracts. This flood of data can overwhelm the network nodes, consuming their computational resources and storage capacity. Data flooding attacks can disrupt the normal operation of the blockchain network, leading to delays in transaction processing and potentially causing nodes to crash or become unresponsive.

3. Sybil Attacks: Sybil attacks involve creating multiple fake identities or nodes to flood the network with fake transactions or data. By controlling a large number of nodes, the attacker can manipulate the blockchain consensus mechanism, disrupt the network, or launch other types of attacks, such as double-spending or eclipse attacks.

These attacks can have serious consequences. Network congestion, increased transaction fees, and reduced network reliability are some of those consequences.

To mitigate flooding attacks, blockchain networks often implement measures such as transaction throttling, fee estimation algorithms, consensus rules, and network monitoring tools. Additionally, community vigilance, timely software updates, and consensus mechanism improvements can help strengthen the resilience of blockchain networks against flooding attacks.

Possible reasons and theories are explored on the Monero Reddit community:

Another theory is that of the Monero Black Marble Flood:

## SBF Jailed

Sam Bankman-Fried sentenced to 25 years in prison over FTX fraud.

Most people are aware and have been following this story. The judge decided however in the end that SBF was a calculating math genius who sought power and influence while knowingly committing wrongdoing. With a series of bad decisions there was never any remorse shown and a 25 year sentence was handed down. 

A great article by The Guardian goes in to the details behind the case:
