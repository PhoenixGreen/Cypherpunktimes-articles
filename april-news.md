## Bitcoin halving

Some background on what Bitcoin Halving is for those unfamiliar. This is an event where the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half. On average this occurs every four years.

With the latest halving transaction fees have skyrocketed meaning it could cost 150$ a transaction. Typically the biggest gains and price appreciation for Bitcoin occur post halving. A news story below confirms this and has the previous gains listed and the predicted gain this year.

Where do you expect to see the price of Bitcoin this time next year? Be sure to comment below and revisit in a year to see if you were right!

## Samourai Wallet

The Samourai wallet is a wallet for Bitcoin that has a strong focus on user privacy as well as security. It is a wallet that attempts to follow the core principles of Bitcoin. Transactions should be decentralized, anonymous, and private.

On April 24, the cryptocurrency market experienced a brief tumble following the news of the arrest of Samourai Wallet Bitcoin founders by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ).

Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill Are Charged with Operating Samourai Wallet, an Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business That Executed Over $2 Billion in Unlawful Transactions and Laundered Over $100 Million in Criminal Proceeds

Recent arrests have been criticised by people in the crypto space. They fear it could be another attempt by the U.S. government to crack down on crypto and the privacy of transactions.

Call it an assault on privacy or an attack on free speech, but the reality on the ground is that any money that flows into an application designed to mix funds to shield user addresses is being treated as laundered funds, no matter the purpose or destination.

What do you think about this situation? Has Bitcoin become part of the financial system it once loathed? Do Bitcoin enthusiasts even realize what is happening or are they just happy because the price is rising? Comment below with your opinions.
