# Julian Assange Free - Kraken IPO - June News Roundup 

# Julian Assange has arrived in Australia after walking free from an American court following a deal with US authorities.

## What did Julian Assange do?

Mr Assange ran Wikileaks, a website that published many confidential or restricted official reports related to war, spying, and corruption. In 2010, it released a video from a US military helicopter that showed civilians being killed in the Iraqi capital Baghdad. It also published thousands of confidential documents supplied by former US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning. These suggested that the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents during the war in Afghanistan. The revelations became a huge story, prompting reaction from all corners of the globe, and led to intense scrutiny of American involvement in foreign conflicts. The US said the leaks had endangered the lives of American personnel. Mr Assange was accused of conspiring to break into its military databases to acquire sensitive information and was charged with 18 offenses. Efforts were made to bring him to the US for prosecution - which he fought for 14 years in some of the world's highest courts. Mr Assange has always argued that he exposed serious abuses by US armed forces and that the case against him was politically motivated.

## Why has Julian Assange been released now?

Mr Assange's release from a UK prison comes after a deal under which he pleaded guilty to one charge under the US Espionage Act. He will spend no time in a US jail. Mr Assange's supporters said the agreement was reached after intense diplomatic efforts and pressure from Australia. The country's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the case had "dragged on too long". The hearing took place in the Northern Mariana Islands, an American territory in the Pacific Ocean.

# Kraken Seeks over $100M Funding Ahead of Potential IPO

Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is seeking over $100 million before a potential initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported. The crypto exchange, founded in San Francisco in 2011, has long discussed going public. This move is reportedly fueled by a surge in investor interest and a perceived softening of regulations against digital assets.

In recent months, US regulators and politicians have shown a more favorable stance toward crypto. The SEC approved exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin in January and made steps toward approving similar funds for Ether in May. Crypto has also emerged as a political issue, with presidential candidates vying to appear crypto-friendly.

News about Kraken going public first emerged in 2021, when the exchange announced that it was considering a public listing in 2022 through a direct market listing. Initially, the exchange planned for a traditional IPO or a merger

Later, Kraken clarified that it was only considering a direct stock market listing as the company was too big for a SPAC merger. In a direct listing, the company goes public without issuing any additional stocks.

Additionally, the company engaged investors to raise fresh capital that will boost its valuation to more than $10 billion. Sources disclosed a potential fundraising round with Fidelity, Tribe Capital, and General Atlantic for an unknown sum, but none of them officially confirmed the report.
