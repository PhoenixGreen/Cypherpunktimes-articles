# Kraken Seeks over $100M Funding Ahead of Potential IPO

Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken is seeking over $100 million before a potential initial public offering (IPO), Bloomberg reported. The crypto exchange, founded in San Francisco in 2011, has long discussed going public. This move is reportedly fueled by a surge in investor interest and a perceived softening of regulations against digital assets.

In recent months, US regulators and politicians have shown a more favorable stance toward crypto. The SEC approved exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin in January and made steps toward approving similar funds for Ether in May. Crypto has also emerged as a political issue, with presidential candidates vying to appear crypto-friendly.

News about Kraken going public first emerged in 2021, when the exchange announced that it was considering a public listing in 2022 through a direct market listing. Initially, the exchange planned for a traditional IPO or a merger

Later, Kraken clarified that it was only considering a direct stock market listing as the company was too big for a SPAC merger. In a direct listing, the company goes public without issuing any additional stocks.

Additionally, the company engaged investors to raise fresh capital that will boost its valuation to more than $10 billion. Sources disclosed a potential fundraising round with Fidelity, Tribe Capital, and General Atlantic for an unknown sum, but none of them officially confirmed the report.
