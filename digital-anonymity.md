# Digital Anonymity - Is it Achievable?


Todays world has ever increasing surveillance. Preserving digital anonymity must be a primary concern.

This article will look at the importance of having anonymity online and the challenges and obstacles that prevent this. We will look at the role of cryptocurrency and other communication tools that try to protect and preserve anonymity.


## Challenges We Face:

There are a large number of challenges to overcome to maintain anonymity online. Constantly activites are being monitored or tracked, data is being exploited or hacked. Whether the challenge comes from government surveillance, corporations collecting data, cyber attacks, people face a huge threat daily to their privacy.

Below is a list of constant threats to anonymity:

1. Government Surveillance:

There has been increased investment in surveillance technology and this often comes with the tagline 'Its in the interest of national security'. The seemingly open collaboration between governments and tech companies is worrying in so far as retention of data, spying and how this can be seen as an invasion of privacy. Laws have been getting up to speed with combatting this but have they gone far enough. In Europe we have General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which offers some protection. A direct quote and meaning of this is:

'GDPR stands for General Data Protection Legislation. It is a European Union (EU) law that came into effect on 25th May 2018. GDPR governs the way in which we can use, process, and store personal data (information about an identifiable, living person).'

Retaining anonymity and protecting oneself when governments continue to implement more and more tracking online is a serious threat to privacy. You could imagine a scenario where you were tracked online buying certain illicit substances, whether you actually made the purchase is unclear or received the substances but maybe this will be stored in a government database that person X from IP address X is linked with brining illicit substances into the country. You can also see the reason why this may be seen in the national interest also as you want to know that the government has the ability to capture anyone that may be brining something in to the country to harm its citizens.

2. Corporations Harvesting Data:
   
Directly targeting people with advertisements based on their searches or what they uploaded to social media platforms or even going as far as collecting information from the microphone on your phone or home devices. For example one day you might have your Instagram app open and start mentioning 'I'd love to buy a new car', all of a sudden you are bombarded across different platforms with advertisements offering new cars. You can't use your phone or computer without constant reminders about new cars and eventually the corporation has you dreaming about new cars before you finally succumb and end up buying one as its firmly implanted in your head like the corporation has a vice like grip on your soul.

3. Theft of Identity and Cybercrime:

Sharing your personal information on line can be a huge challenge. Whether it be ransomware attacks or theft of identity it is difficult to protect. You want to buy something from say a coffee shop online, you have to provide your name, email, address, phone number and payment details. How many different websites will you have to provide the same details over and over again. Do you believe they store that data securely? You take an ever increasing risk each time. 

It was suggested to me that an accountless profile should be possible online. Where one can roam freely and purchase goods with just a public key. If the goods need to be delievered they can be delivered to a Parcel collection facility. Why should I need to provide more info than is necessary.

4. Advancements in Technology:
   
Nowadays facial recognition, biometric data, and advanced tracking methods can be used to identify individuals online and offline. We can only look to China as the leader in this area. Will it lead to a place with a worldwide social credit system and score? Could your data be cloned and mistakenly you are blacklisted as a criminal and can't travel by plane?

6. Importance of Awareness and Education:
   
People need to be more informed about how their data is being used. The tools to protect your data need to be easy to use. Education is key in this area because it still appears that the average user doesn't know what data is being shared and where to check and where to control sharing.

7. Laws:
   
The laws are different across all countries and continents. What might be protected in Europe may not be protected in the UK or US. How do I know when I travel to another country as an EU citizen that the country I arrive in will not be harvesting my data when I log on from the hotel room. 

8. Social Engineering:

Attacks where somebody is able to take on your persona online and ruin your life are becoming more prevalent. Recently I watched 'Can I Tell You A Secret' on Netflix. It is based on the cyberstalking crimes of Matthew Hardy who lived in the UK. For whatever reason he picked random people online and used their data against them to manipulate and ruin their lives.

9. Profiting from Surveillance or more commonly known as Surveillance Capitalism:
    
Users can often trade their personal information for free services without knowing they may be compromising their privacy. This data then may be sold to a corporation or used by someone to try and make profits from individuals.
